        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Master's student in Astrophysics, currently pursuing research on the interstellar medium (ISM). My work involves analyzing complex datasets and simulations to understand the physical and chemical processes that govern the lifecycle of stars and galaxies.

        <p>
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about coding and visual arts. This website serves as a portfolio of my research, a platform for my thoughts on science and technology, and a gallery for my creative projects.
