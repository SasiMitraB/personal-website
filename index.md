        <p>
           Hello There!

           My name is Sasi Mitra, currently a Fifth Year BSMS Student at IISER Tirupati. I am currently working on my Master's thesis at the Australian National University, under the supervision of Dr. Amit Seta. As part of my Master's Thesis, I'm looking towards trying to understand the morphology of Star Forming regions, using tools that are sensitive to higher-order moments, such as Minkowski functionals.

            Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about coding, watching movies, and reading novels. This website serves as a portfolio of my research, a platform for my thoughts on science and technology, and a gallery for nonsense I build and think needs a platform..
