        <p>
           Hello There!

           My name is Sasi Mitra, currently a Fifth Year BSMS Student at IISER Tirupati. I am currently working on my Master's thesis at the Australian National University, under the supervision of Dr. Amit Seta. As part of my Master's Thesis, I am studying the statistical properties of 3D ISM Distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about coding, watching movies, and reading novels. This website serves as a portfolio of my research, a platform for my thoughts on science and technology, and a gallery for nonsense I build and think needs a platform..
